## Final Architecture

### Local Development
- **Frontend**: Express.js server at `localhost:3000`
- **Scraper**: Python subprocess execution
- **API**: Node.js with Gemini integration

### Production (GCP)
- **Frontend**: App Engine static hosting (`https://tdnet-viewer-1750036151.uc.r.appspot.com`)
- **API Function**: Cloud Functions Node.js (`https://us-central1-tdnet-viewer-1750036151.cloudfunctions.net/tdnet-api`)
- **Scraper Function**: Cloud Functions Python (`https://us-central1-tdnet-viewer-1750036151.cloudfunctions.net/tdnet-scraper`)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash integration
- **Cost**: Less than $5/month with serverless auto-scaling

## Key Pattern: User-Driven Development

The development followed a clear pattern:
- User makes specific request
- Implementation provided
- User tests and reports issues
- Issues fixed immediately
- Process repeats with next enhancement

This iterative approach resulted in a robust, user-focused application that exactly meets the specified requirements.
