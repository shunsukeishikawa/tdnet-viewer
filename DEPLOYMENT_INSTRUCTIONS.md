# üöÄ GCP Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Complete Authentication

Since you need a browser for Google Cloud authentication, please run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add gcloud to your PATH (add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/shunsuke/google-cloud-sdk/bin"

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# Set your project (create one if you don't have it)
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

## Step 2: Create a GCP Project (if needed)

If you don't have a GCP project yet:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Create Project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "tdnet-viewer")
4. Note the Project ID (it will be something like "tdnet-viewer-123456")

## Step 3: Enable Billing

**Important**: Cloud Functions require billing to be enabled on your project.

1. Go to [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2. Link a billing account to your project
3. Don't worry - the serverless architecture should cost less than $5/month for moderate usage

## Step 4: Deploy the Application

Once authentication is complete, run the deployment script:

```bash
cd /Users/shunsuke/dev/iragents
./deploy.sh
```

## Step 5: Configure Gemini AI (Optional)

If you want AI-powered PDF summarization:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
gcloud functions deploy tdnet-api \
    --update-env-vars GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

## What the Deployment Script Does

The `deploy.sh` script will:

1. ‚úÖ Enable required Google Cloud APIs
2. ‚úÖ Deploy Python scraper function to Cloud Functions
3. ‚úÖ Deploy Node.js API function to Cloud Functions  
4. ‚úÖ Deploy frontend to App Engine
5. ‚úÖ Configure all environment variables
6. ‚úÖ Display your live application URLs

## Expected Output

After deployment, you'll see something like:

```
üéâ Deployment completed successfully!

üìç Your application URLs:
   Frontend:        https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.uc.r.appspot.com
   API Function:    https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/tdnet-api
   Scraper Function: https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/tdnet-scraper
```

## Cost Estimation

With the serverless architecture:
- **App Engine**: Free tier for low usage
- **Cloud Functions**: ~$0.50-2.00/month for moderate usage
- **Total**: Less than $5/month

## Local Development Still Works

You can continue using local development:

```bash
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Project not found"**: Make sure you set the correct project ID
2. **"Billing not enabled"**: Enable billing in the Google Cloud Console
3. **"APIs not enabled"**: The script enables them automatically, but you can manually enable:
   - Cloud Functions API
   - App Engine API
   - Cloud Storage API

### View Logs:

```bash
# API function logs
gcloud functions logs read tdnet-api --region=us-central1

# Scraper function logs
gcloud functions logs read tdnet-scraper --region=us-central1

# App Engine logs
gcloud app logs tail -s default
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the authentication steps above
2. Run `./deploy.sh`
3. Test your live application
4. Optionally configure Gemini AI for PDF summaries

Your application will be live on Google Cloud Platform with automatic scaling and cost-effective serverless architecture!
